Okay, let's focus on the conference version of the ResShift paper (NeurIPS 2023,
arXiv:2307.12348v3). This version specifically targets image super-resolution (SR)
and uses **15 sampling steps**, operating in the VQGAN latent space.

Here's a breakdown of potential shortcomings based on this specific version and
ideas for experiments to explore them:

**Recap of Conference Version's Key Points:**

*   **Focus:** Efficient Diffusion for x4 Image Super-Resolution.
*   **Mechanism:** Markov chain transfers HR <-> LR by shifting residuals over
    **T=15 steps**. Starts process conceptually near LR, not Gaussian noise.
*   **Implementation:** Uses UNet + Swin Transformer blocks in VQGAN latent space.
    Recommends hyperparameters `T=15`, `p=0.3`, `κ=2.0`.
*   **Claim:** Achieves SOTA or comparable results *for a diffusion model* with
    significantly fewer steps (15) than standard diffusion (e.g., LDM needing
    hundreds/thousands) without the performance drop seen in accelerated LDM
    (DDIM). Acknowledges it's slower than GANs. Shows favorable
    perception-distortion trade-off vs. LDM (Fig 7).
*   **Limitations Mentioned:** Slower than GANs; fails on some complex real-world
    images (e.g., comics, Fig 9), potentially due to limits of synthetic
    degradation training.

**Potential Shortcomings & Experimental Ideas (Conference Version Focus):**

1.  **Latent Space Fidelity Ceiling:**
    *   **Shortcoming:** Operating in VQGAN's compressed latent space inherently
        limits the maximum achievable pixel-level fidelity (PSNR/SSIM), regardless
        of how well the residual shifting works. This might be less apparent when
        comparing against other latent diffusion models or GANs (which also have
        limitations) but could be a significant gap compared to top pixel-space
        methods.
    *   **Experimental Idea:**
        *   **Benchmark Comparison:** Evaluate the 15-step ResShift on standard SR
            benchmarks (Set5, Set14, Urban100, Manga109) where PSNR/SSIM are key
            metrics. Compare directly against top-performing pixel-space SR methods
            (e.g., SwinIR, HAT, or newer Transformer/CNN models).
        *   **Content Focus:** Test specifically on images rich in fine,
            high-frequency details (e.g., textures, text, architectural details)
            where VQGAN artifacts might become noticeable upon close inspection,
            even if perceptual scores are good.
        *   **Quantify Gap:** Analyze the PSNR/SSIM difference between ResShift and
            pixel-space SOTA. Is there a consistent gap attributable to the latent
            space bottleneck?

2.  **Robustness to Degradations Beyond Training:**
    *   **Shortcoming:** The paper trains on a specific synthetic degradation
        pipeline (RealESRGAN-style + bicubic variations). The 15-step process,
        optimized for this, might not generalize well to real-world images with
        significantly different or more complex degradations (e.g., motion blur,
        sensor noise, JPEG artifacts beyond the trained range, atmospheric
        effects). The failure on the comic image (Fig 9) hints at this.
    *   **Experimental Idea:**
        *   **Cross-Degradation Testing:** Take the official ResShift model (trained
            on its reported pipeline) and test it *without retraining* on datasets
            with known, different degradation types (e.g., motion blur datasets,
            datasets with heavy noise/JPEG compression, datasets with unique sensor
            characteristics).
        *   **Real-World Challenge Sets:** Evaluate extensively on challenging
            real-world SR datasets known for diverse and unknown degradations (e.g.,
            DRealSR, RealSRSet, maybe specialized datasets like low-light SR).
        *   **Comparison:** Compare against methods explicitly designed for blind SR
            (like BSRGAN, RealESRGAN) or methods that estimate degradation kernels at
            test time.
        *   **Analysis:** Look for specific failure modes – does ResShift fail to
            deblur, introduce color artifacts, or amplify noise when the degradation
            mismatches its training assumptions?

3.  **Limited Generative Capability / Detail Hallucination:**
    *   **Shortcoming:** While aiming for realism, the 15-step process starting
        "close" to the LR image might have less capacity to hallucinate *plausible*
        and *diverse* high-frequency details compared to a longer diffusion process
        starting from pure noise. This could lead to results that are sharp but
        lack intricate textures found in ground truth or generated by more powerful
        models. The trade-off shown with parameter `p` (Fig 4, Table 1) suggests
        higher `p` (closer to LR) improves reference metrics but hurts non-reference
        (realism) metrics. The chosen `p=0.3` might still be conservative.
    *   **Experimental Idea:**
        *   **Difficult Texture Synthesis:** Test on images where significant texture
            generation is required (e.g., animal fur, foliage, detailed fabrics from
            very low resolution).
        *   **Diversity Test:** For selected LR inputs where multiple valid HR
            details are possible (e.g., restoring patterns, generating plausible
            background details), run ResShift with multiple random seeds and compare
            the output diversity (visually and maybe quantitatively using sample
            variance metrics) against LDM (run for 100+ steps) or a strong GAN.
        *   **Qualitative Comparison:** Side-by-side visual comparison focusing on
            the quality and complexity of generated textures compared to SOTA GANs
            (known for strong hallucination) and longer-run diffusion models.

4.  **Sensitivity to Configuration (T=15, p=0.3, κ=2.0):**
    *   **Shortcoming:** The paper identifies `T=15, p=0.3, κ=2.0` as a good balance
        based on ImageNet tests. Is this setting optimal across different *types* of
        images (e.g., faces, text, architecture)? Does performance degrade sharply
        outside this narrow configuration?
    *   **Experimental Idea:**
        *   **Domain-Specific Tuning:** Re-run the ablation study from Table 1 / Fig
            4, but evaluate performance on specific domains (e.g., using CelebA-HQ
            for faces, a dataset with text images). Does the optimal `T, p, κ`
            combination shift?
        *   **Step Sensitivity:** Analyze the impact of slightly varying `T` (e.g.,
            10, 20, 25 steps) more closely. Is 15 truly a sweet spot, or does
            performance plateau/improve slightly with more steps at an acceptable
            speed cost? Compare the performance-per-step curve against accelerated
            LDM again.

5.  **Efficiency in the Current Landscape:**
    *   **Shortcoming:** The claim of being an "efficient diffusion model" was
        relative to LDM (NeurIPS 2023 context). The field of efficient diffusion
        and SR advances rapidly.
    *   **Experimental Idea:**
        *   **Benchmark vs. Newer Methods:** Compare ResShift (15 steps) against
            diffusion models, samplers (e.g., LCM, SDXL-Turbo related techniques if
            adapted for SR), or even non-diffusion SR methods published *after*
            NeurIPS 2023 that claim state-of-the-art efficiency or speed/quality
            trade-offs.
        *   **Update Perception-Distortion Plot:** Recreate Fig 7, adding newer
            relevant methods to see if ResShift's curve is still superior or if
            others now offer better trade-offs.
        *   **Hardware Considerations:** Evaluate inference speed on consistent,
            modern hardware (e.g., recent GPUs) for fair comparison.

These ideas aim to build upon the conference paper's findings and probe its
limitations within the specific context of 15-step, latent-space SR. Let's
discuss which of these avenues seem most promising or relevant to your goals!
